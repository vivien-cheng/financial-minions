          "explanation": "To assess whether 3M is a capital-intensive business, we need to evaluate how much of its revenue is spent on capital expenditures (CAPEX), the proportion of its assets that are fixed, and how efficiently it uses its assets to generate profit. The CAPEX/Revenue ratio indicates the percentage of revenue spent on capital expenditures, which is a direct measure of capital intensity. The Fixed Assets/Total Assets ratio shows the proportion of total assets that are fixed, indicating the level of investment in long-term assets. Return on Assets (ROA) measures how effectively the company uses its assets to generate profit.",

From the data, Property, plant and equipment, net for 2022 is $8,200 million and Total assets is $45,000 million. Thus, Fixed Assets/Total Assets = 8,200 / 45,000 = 0.1822. \n\nTo calculate the Return on Assets (ROA), I used the formula: ROA = Net income / Total assets.

The Fixed Assets/Total Assets Ratio of 0.1822 suggests that 18.22% of 3M's total assets are fixed assets, which is not particularly high for a capital-intensive industry. Typically, capital-intensive businesses have a higher proportion of fixed assets. The ROA of 0.1118, or 11.18%, indicates a strong ability to generate profit from its assets, which is generally favorable.

The key metrics calculated are as follows:\n\n1. **CAPEX/Revenue Ratio**: 0.0438, indicating that 3M spends approximately 4.38% of its revenue on capital expenditures. This is a moderate level of investment in capital assets relative to revenue.\n\n2. **Fixed Assets/Total Assets Ratio**: 0.1822, showing that 18.22% of 3M's total assets are fixed assets. This proportion is not particularly high for a capital-intensive industry, which typically has a much larger share of fixed assets.\n\n3. **Return on Assets (ROA)**: 0.1118, or 11.18%, reflecting a strong ability to generate profit from its assets, which is generally favorable.\n\nThese metrics suggest that while 3M does invest in capital assets, it is not excessively capital-intensive compared to industries like manufacturing or utilities, where these ratios would be significantly higher. Therefore, 3M is not considered a capital-intensive business."
