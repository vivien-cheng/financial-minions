          "explanation": "The Inventory Turnover Ratio is a measure of how efficiently a company manages its inventory. It indicates how many times a company's inventory is sold and replaced over a period. This ratio is calculated by dividing the Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) by the average inventory during the period. For AES Corporation, the COGS can be derived from the 'Total cost of sales' provided in the financial data, and the average inventory is calculated using the inventory figures from the balance sheets for the two years provided.",
