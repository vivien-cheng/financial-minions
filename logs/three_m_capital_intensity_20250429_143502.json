          "explanation": "To assess whether 3M is a capital-intensive business, we need to evaluate its capital expenditure relative to its revenue, the proportion of fixed assets in its total assets, and its efficiency in using assets to generate profit. The CAPEX/Revenue ratio indicates how much of the company's revenue is being reinvested into capital expenditures, which is a key indicator of capital intensity. The Fixed Assets/Total Assets ratio shows the proportion of the company's assets that are fixed, which is another indicator of capital intensity. Return on Assets (ROA) measures how efficiently the company is using its assets to generate profit.",
