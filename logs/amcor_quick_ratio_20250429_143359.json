          "explanation": "The Quick Ratio is a measure of a company's ability to meet its short-term obligations using its most liquid assets. It excludes inventory from current assets because inventory is not as easily converted to cash as other current assets. The Quick Ratio is calculated by subtracting inventory from current assets and then dividing by current liabilities.",
          "citation": "The quick ratio is a measure of a company's short-term liquidity position and is calculated as (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities. It is a more conservative measure than the current ratio because it excludes inventory, which may not be as liquid.",

Inventories include both 'Raw Materials and Supplies' and 'Work in Process and Finished Goods'. I subtracted these inventory components from the Total Current Assets for each year to get the Quick Assets. The Quick Ratio is then calculated by dividing Quick Assets by Total Current Liabilities for each year.",

          "explanation": "To calculate the Quick Ratio, I divided Quick Assets by Current Liabilities for each fiscal year. For FY2023, the Quick Assets are 3095 and the Current Liabilities are 4476. Thus, the Quick Ratio for FY2023 is 3095 / 4476 = 0.6915. For FY2022, the Quick Assets are 3414 and the Current Liabilities are 5103. Thus, the Quick Ratio for FY2022 is 3414 / 5103 = 0.6689. To find the percentage change in the Quick Ratio from FY2022 to FY2023, I used the formula: ((Quick Ratio FY2023 - Quick Ratio FY2022) / Quick Ratio FY2022) * 100. This results in ((0.6915 - 0.6689) / 0.6689) * 100 = 3.37%.",
